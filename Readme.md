# SQLcl Project – Real-World Deployment Patterns & Best Practices

This repository contains **practical guidance**, **field-tested patterns**, and **ready-to-use workflows** for implementing reliable database and APEX deployments using **Oracle SQLcl Project**.

The goal is to provide what Oracle’s documentation does not:  
**How SQLcl Project behaves in real, messy, multi-schema, multi-environment systems — and how to use it safely on production projects.**

If you are working on medium-to-large Oracle APEX or PL/SQL systems, this repository gives you the missing manual for Git-driven, automated deployments.

---

## 🚀 What This Repository Covers

### ✔ End-to-end deployment workflows  
Development → Deployment Test → TEST → PROD  
With and without CI/CD.

### ✔ SQLcl Project best practices  
How to structure schemas, exports, filters, branches, and deploy artifacts.

### ✔ Drift detection & baseline synchronization  
How to detect what changed, why, and how to realign environments safely.

### ✔ Handling complex APEX deployments  
Restoring APEX metadata, preserving app states, dealing with REST, ACLs, credentials, and background jobs.

### ✔ Hotfix / emergency patch workflow  
How to safely patch production without corrupting mainline development.

### ✔ Security recommendations  
Permissions, roles, deployment accounts, secrets, network ACLs, and schema isolation.

### ✔ Real SQLcl Project bugs & enhancements  
A curated set of reproducible findings from real enterprise environments.

### ✔ Common commands & scripts  
Frequently used SQLcl, Liquibase, Git, and APEX commands for deployment pipelines.
